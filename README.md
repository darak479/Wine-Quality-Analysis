Wine Quality Prediction
This project explores a dataset of Portuguese wines to understand the factors that influence their quality. The goal is to analyze the chemical properties of the wines and build predictive models to classify them based on quality.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various physicochemical properties of the wines, including:

Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (score between 0 and 10)
Analysis
The analysis includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to visualize relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing, including normalization using MinMaxScaler.
Model Building using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict wine quality.
Model Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
Run the Jupyter Notebook wine-quality.ipynb to perform the analysis and train the models.
Results
The models achieved decent accuracy in predicting wine quality based on the chemical properties. The analysis provides insights into the factors that contribute to a good quality wine.

Future Work
Experiment with other machine learning algorithms to improve predictive performance.
Incorporate additional features or datasets to enhance the analysis.
Develop a web application to allow users to input wine properties and get a quality prediction.
